# pdfgetx3_gui
a gui for running PDFgetX3. I think it's a little easier to use than the interactive mode in PDFgetX3, but not quite as good as XPDFsuite. Requires PDFGetX3 https://www.diffpy.org/products/pdfgetx.html.

Plots should update by changing values in the boxes. It does tend to crash if you try to update to fast. To run do "python pdfgetx3_gui.py" in the terminal.
